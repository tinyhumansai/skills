## Features

### Telegram Integration

Connect your Telegram account and manage everything from one place. Read and send messages, search across chats, get summaries of conversations you missed, and automate common workflows.

### Skills Marketplace

AlphaHuman uses a pluggable **skills** architecture. Each skill connects to an external service and exposes actions that you (or the AI) can perform. Telegram is the first skill, with many more on the way.

### AI-Powered Automation

Built-in AI understands your intent and can execute multi-step actions across your connected services. Ask it to summarize a group chat, draft a reply, or find a message from last week -- it handles the rest.

### Privacy-First

Your data stays on your machine. AlphaHuman runs as a native desktop app (not a web app), stores credentials in your OS keychain, and connects directly to services without routing your data through third-party servers.

## Getting Started

1. **Download** the installer for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/alphahumanxyz/alphahuman/releases/latest)
2. **Install** the app (drag to Applications on macOS, or use your package manager on Linux)
3. **Connect Telegram** -- follow the in-app onboarding to link your Telegram account
4. **Start using** -- ask the AI assistant to help you manage your Telegram, or explore the features yourself
